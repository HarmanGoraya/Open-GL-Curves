# Open-GL-Curves

## How To Use Program
An example of the input file is given in the project it is called input.txt

***Important the control points must be between [-1,1] for them to be shown on the screen

** In addition the file must be passed as a command line argument

For the curves you can switch between them and you can switch between making a bezier or b spline curve

## What is implemented

● De Casteljau algorithm

● De boor algorithm

● Adding, Deleting, Inserting, and modifying Control points for the Curves

● Changing Resolution of Curve

● You can Output your results to a file that will be named output.txt
